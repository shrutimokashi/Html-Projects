            ussian forces bombed and destroyed a bridge in the encircled city of Chernihiv, the region's governor, Viacheslav Chaus, said. 
            The destroyed bridge had been used for evacuating civilians and delivering humanitarian aid. It crossed the Desna River and 
            connected the city to Ukraine's capital, Kyiv. Chernihiv authorities said Tuesday that the encircled city has no water or 
            electricity and called the situation there a humanitarian disaster. Explosions and bursts of gunfire shook Kyiv on Wednesday
             morning, and heavy artillery fire could be heard from the northwest, where Russian forces have sought to encircle and take the 
             capital's suburbs.
